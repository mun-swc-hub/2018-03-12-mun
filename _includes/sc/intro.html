  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools:
  using the Shell for task automation, Git/GitHub
  for version control, and basic to intermediate R
  programming skills, including manipulating data with {dplyr},
  generating figures with {ggplot2}, and
  creating dynamic R markdown documents with {knitr}.
  
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
